1.  What is the order of growth of $n^3 + n^2$? What about
    $1000000 n^3 + n^2$? What about $n^3 + 1000000 n^2$?

They are both cubic functions

2.  What is the order of growth of $(n^2 + n) \cdot (n + 1)$? Before you
    start multiplying, remember that you only need the leading term.

I'm not quite sure what the "$" outside the first set of paranthesis are along with the "\cdot," but I suppose they might be a linear order

3.  If $f$ is in $O(g)$, for some unspecified function $g$, what can we
    say about $af+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants?

af+b will not grow at the same rate as f in function of g according to the article

4.  If $f_1$ and $f_2$ are in $O(g)$, what can we say about $f_1 + f_2$?

f_1 + f_2 should grow exponentially

5.  If $f_1$ is in $O(g)$ and $f_2$ is in $O(h)$, what can we say about
    $f_1 + f_2$?
This f_1 + f_2 should grow linearly?

6.  If $f_1$ is in $O(g)$ and $f_2$ is in $O(h)$, what can we say about
    $f_1 \cdot f_2$?

I'm not sure what \cdot represents, I have no idea what the question here is asking.
